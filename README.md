# Welcome to the Experimentality's Front-End technical test üê±‚Äçüë§

Hi! My name is Alejandro Casta√±o Rojas and I'm applying to the Experimentality company to be a new member of the **team**. In this repository, you will find a solution to the technical test proposed by the company to be a Front-End developer üê±‚Äçüíª.


## Tools used
![Angular CLI](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular--cli-6.1.3-%23cc0000.svg) ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-6-crimson.svg) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-8.11.2-green.svg) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-2.9.2-blue.svg)
All these tools are necessary üòÖ, but do not worry, the Angular CLI package comes by default with all of these üê±‚ÄçüöÄ (except Node, however Node comes with NPM, and NPM install the Angular CLI package... So **Node > Angular CLI** :v)

##   Preparation of the environment and installation

First of all we must install NodeJS if we do not have it installed on our machine. To verify if we have it installed it is necessary to write
```
node -v
```
And it must show us the version, then we must do the same verification with NPM
```
npm -v
```
Once verified, what we should do is install Angular CLI if we do not have it installed.
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
And it is verified that it is installed
```
ng --version
```
Then we must locate on the project folder and make sure that all its dependencies are installed (We do not want to see warning messages in our console). For this we use:
```
npm install
```
Or if you have Yarn installed, you can use it ~~It's faster than NPM, but don't tell it, it gets jealous and starts developing NPX~~
```
yarn install
```
Once we have everything configured just run the project with
```
ng serve -o
```
